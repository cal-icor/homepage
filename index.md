# JupyterHubs are currently being deployed for use!

We are in the process of deploying [JupyterHubs](https://jupyter.org/hub) for use by California public higher education institutions. These JupyterHubs will provide free access to Jupyter notebooks, Python, R, and other tools for data science education for California state institutions. The pilot phase began in Summer 2025, with a full rollout coming for Fall 2025. The JupyterHubs will be hosted on cloud infrastructure, ensuring scalability and accessibility for all students and educators.

## Sign-up for access to our cloud-based Jupyter Hub

Please <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IN3b19WWPbTiAu8WR4tTBZwwMAY-NYS8EgH3I1eGQEI/edit?ts=66f34eb2">sign-up</a> if you would like a JupyterHub configured for your institution.

## Project Documentation

The technical details of our platform, including supporting documentation for instructors, support resouces and user policies is found [here](https://docs.cal-icor.org).

## Github Organization

The [cal-icor organization](https://github.com/cal-icor) hosts the project on GitHub. You can find the source code, issue trackers, and other resources there. All code is open source and licensed under the BSD-3-Clause License.

## Interactive Textbook of Interdisciplinary Modules

We have build an [interactive textbook](https://cal-icor.github.io/textbook) which is a collection of interactive notebooks, which you can launch through our server ([jupyter.cal-icor.org](https://jupyter.cal-icor.org)), through public sources like [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or your own private server (e.g. [datahub.berkeley.edu](https://datahub.berkeley.edu)).

## Project Vision

The Partnership for Establishing a California Interactive Computing Open Resource (Cal-ICOR) aims to revolutionize data science education across California's public higher education institutions by providing equitable, cloud-based access to Jupyter notebooks and comprehensive instructor support. Our mission is to empower educators and students with the tools and training necessary to foster innovative, engaging learning experiences.

## Key Strategies

- **Centralized JupyterHub Platform:** Utilize existing infrastructure and expertise to build a scalable, user-friendly platform that eliminates technical and financial barriers for institutions and students.
- **Dynamic Content Ecosystem:** Expand on UC Berkeley's Data Science Modules, developing a public-facing platform with diverse, accessible, and inclusive content that can be implemented across various STEM disciplines.
- **Educator Empowerment:** Provide comprehensive training workshops and support, focusing on content creation, customization, and inclusive teaching practices.
- **Sustainability and Scalability:** Develop a robust infrastructure and team to manage the system, analyze successful models, and build capacity to support tens of thousands of students.

## Partnerships

Cal-ICOR will collaborate with a network of public higher education institutions across California, including community colleges, California State Universities, and University of California campuses. Key partners include the City College of San Francisco, Santa Barbara City College, and California State University, Long Beach.
This initiative will leverage existing networks such as the California Alliance for Data Science Education and the California Engineering Liaison Council to enhance outreach and engagement. Additionally non-profit 2I2C will provide guidance on JupyterHub architecture We will draw on successful models from previous JupyterHub implementations, ensuring best practices in accessibility and resource sharing. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, Cal-ICOR aims to create a sustainable framework for integrating data science education throughout Californiaâ€™s public higher education landscape.

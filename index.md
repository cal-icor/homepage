## Project Vision
The Partnership for Establishing a California Interactive Computing Open Resource (Cal-ICOR) aims to revolutionize data science education across California's public higher education institutions by providing equitable, cloud-based access to Jupyter notebooks and comprehensive instructor support. Our mission is to empower educators and students with the tools and training necessary to foster innovative, engaging learning experiences.

## Key Strategies

- **Centralized JupyterHub Platform:** Utilize existing infrastructure and expertise to build a scalable, user-friendly platform that eliminates technical and financial barriers for institutions and students.
- **Dynamic Content Ecosystem:** Expand on UC Berkeley's Data Science Modules, developing a public-facing platform with diverse, accessible, and inclusive content that can be implemented across various STEM disciplines.
- **Educator Empowerment:** Provide comprehensive training workshops and support, focusing on content creation, customization, and inclusive teaching practices.
- **Sustainability and Scalability:** Develop a robust infrastructure and team to manage the system, analyze successful models, and build capacity to support tens of thousands of students.

## Partnerships

Cal-ICOR will collaborate with a network of public higher education institutions across California, including community colleges, California State Universities, and University of California campuses. Key partners include the City College of San Francisco, Santa Barbara City College, and California State University, Long Beach.
This initiative will leverage existing networks such as the California Alliance for Data Science Education and the California Engineering Liaison Council to enhance outreach and engagement. Additionally non-profit 2I2C will provide guidance on JupyterHub architecture We will draw on successful models from previous JupyterHub implementations, ensuring best practices in accessibility and resource sharing. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, Cal-ICOR aims to create a sustainable framework for integrating data science education throughout Californiaâ€™s public higher education landscape.

      <h2>A Statewide Infrastructure for Equitable Access to Industry-Standard Programming and Data Science Tools</h2>
      <p>Cal-ICOR (California Interactive Computing Open Resource) is a UC Berkeley-led initiative supported by the California Education Learning Lab. Our mission is to bring high-quality, cloud-hosted Jupyter environments and modular data-science curricula to public colleges and universities across California with zero local installation, zero software maintenance, and equal access for every student, regardless of device or financial and educational background.</p>
      <p class="mission-statement"><strong>Our mission is simple: ensure that every student in California has access to the tools, skills, and learning environments that prepare them for data-rich careers and civic participation.</strong></p>

    <p class="section-subtitle">Cal-ICOR makes it simple for California educators to bring modern computing into their classrooms without technical barriers or extra workload. By joining the network, institutions gain access to a shared cloud-based JupyterHub, hands-on support, and teaching environments designed for real data science learning. We partner directly with faculty and campus teams so they can focus on instruction, not infrastructure.</p>

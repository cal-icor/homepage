Cal-ICOR's course materials are built to make high-quality data science education easy to adopt and adapt across California's diverse higher-education institutions. These resources reflect our core principles: **accessible instruction**, **resource sharing**, and a **collaborative ecosystem** that empowers instructors to teach data science confidently, regardless of prior experience or technical capacity.

Our materials are designed to integrate seamlessly into existing courses or serve as a foundation for new ones. In a Cal-ICOR partnership, our team works with you to tailor these materials to your campus, discipline, and student needs. This page offers a preview of what participating instructors can use and build upon.

The California Interactive Computing Open Resource (Cal-ICOR) initiative is a statewide effort to expand high-quality, accessible data science education across the University of California, California State University, and California Community College systems. Led by UC Berkeley and supported by the California Education Learning Lab, Cal-ICOR builds shared infrastructure, curriculum, and instructor support that lower the barriers to offering data-enabled learning, no matter the size, resources, or technical capacity of an institution.

<p class="mission-statement"><strong>Our mission is simple: ensure that every student in California has access to the tools, skills, and learning environments that prepare them for data-rich careers and civic participation.</strong></p>

## Why Cal-ICOR Matters

Data literacy is now foundational across disciplines: from public health to business, from social sciences to the arts. Yet many colleges face persistent challenges: insufficient computing infrastructure, uneven access to high-quality instructional materials and limited resources to train or support instructors.

Cal-ICOR addresses these challenges at scale by providing:

- **Cloud and browser-based interactive computing environments** that eliminate the need for local infrastructure
- **Open, modular curricular materials** that instructors can easily adopt and adapt
- **Collaborative professional support** that empowers faculty across all disciplines, not just STEM
- **A statewide network** that shares innovations, strategies, and resources across institutions

In doing so, Cal-ICOR strengthens pathways into data science for tens of thousands of students, many of whom have historically lacked access to computing-intensive learning experiences.

## Our Vision for Statewide Impact

Cal-ICOR is designed not as a short-term project, but as statewide educational infrastructure—an enduring ecosystem of tools, practices, and partnerships that grows stronger over time. Our long-term goals include:

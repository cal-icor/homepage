  title: How Cal-ICOR Works With Your Campus
  subtitle: Cal-ICOR is designed to make it simple for any California public higher-education institution to bring high-quality, cloud-based computing and data science instruction to their students. Whether you're building your first data-enabled course or scaling a full program, our team works directly with faculty and instructional staff to provide ready-to-use materials, technical infrastructure, and personalized support so instructors can focus on teaching, not troubleshooting. Our approach is flexible, collaborative, and tailored to the needs of each campus. You tell us your teaching goals, constraints, and timelines – Cal-ICOR helps you get there.

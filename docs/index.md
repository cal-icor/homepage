## Project Vision
The Partnership for Establishing a California Interactive Computing Open Resource (Cal-ICOR) aims to revolutionize data science education across California's public higher education institutions by providing equitable, cloud-based access to Jupyter notebooks and comprehensive instructor support. Our mission is to empower educators and students with the tools and training necessary to foster innovative, engaging learning experiences.
